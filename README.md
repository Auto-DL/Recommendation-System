## Why this repo
This repo acts as a base for building the recommendation system for the auto generation of the layers as well as a hub to gather/scrape the data for the same. The models generated over here are used to better the model building system in the main repo of [AutoDL](https://github.com/Auto-DL/Auto-DL).  
The goal of this repo is to create a system that can automatically recommend a SOTA deep learning model catered to the personalized needs of the user.
